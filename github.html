    <h2>The Carter Case</h2>
    <div class="story">
      PART I: MURDER IN THE OUTBACKS<br><br>
A scream, a thud, police sirens going their usual rythmic tone of 'Wee Woo' enough to make any sleeping child wake up, and the annoying noise, not to mention that police sirens were equally annoying too, were the sound of reporters asking the same set of question a hundred times. These were the sound that the residents near the house of the Mayor of the city Cloville, Mrs. Evelyn Carter heard around 6 on the dreadful date of 17th October, 2008. And if it wasn't obvious enough, Mrs. Carter had fell two stories and died, and thus the conundrum.<br><br>

Mr. Garcia, a 30-year-old neighbour of the mayor, was the one to dial 911 and allert the authorities. Along with him, the concerned nighbours were Mr. and Mrs. Evans, the Winchester family, the Rory's and the elderly couples Mr and Mrs. Sinclair.<br> <br>

Along with the above listed families, there was only one resident living along with Evelyn, her ten-year-old neice, Ralphene Lee. Ralphene was the one to handle all of Evelyn's medications and take care of her. In return, Evelyn would look after her, and this was the way it had been going since Ralphene's parents passed away in a car accident when she was a month old.<br><br>

The case file dropped on the table of the town detective, Artur Leghorne. Arthur had no prior experience in any murder let alone the case of the city Mayor. Luck would have him board the train to Cloville from Brawk and set up his own agency. All these events leading to him getting this case.<br><br>

<hr>
PART II: THE SLAVE OF HONOR<br><br>

With a lack of evidence, the case had come on to an annticlimatic end, which was probably for the better. The case was marked as "accidental".<br><br>

The case was now done and dusted, and the next step was to report his findings to the town sheriff, Joseph Wilkins.<br><br>

Upon reaching his office at half-past-ten, Arthur foound out that his was already occupied. <br>
<br>
'Arthur', Joseph called out just as Arthur was about to exit the room and wait in the lobby, 'We were just discussing your case just now'<br>
<br>
This line peaked Arthur's curiosity. It was random, but, who in the town would this case be discussed between except Arthur and the sheriff themselves. <br><br>

The guest opposite Joseeph, who Arthur had initially noticed, now left his chair. The man was of a very squarish build, and had the strength of, Arthur guessed, atleast ten elephants. Dressed in a black suit, the man was the most intimidating person Arthur had come accross.<br><br>

'Good to meet you Arthur', the man spoke.
'Arthur', the sheriff next spoke. "This is the newly elected mayor, MR. Vincent.'<br>
Arthur, after shaking away his initial fright on seeing the mayor, began his synopsis on the case.<br>
'I've solved the case', he began with.<br>
'Very quick, isn't it Arthur' a moment of awe was visible in the sheriff's eyes.<br>
'Tell me about it then', the mayor implored in a firm voice.<br>
'The death was accidental. Lack of evidence, and no suspects seem out of place'<br><br>

On this report of Arthur, the sheriff seemed disappointed, which Arthur picked on how his tone of voice changed from a golly man voiced like an excited child, to a depressing man within moments after Athur's dialogue.
<br><br>
The mayor too didn't look pleased. The tone of the room changed drastically for Arthur.<br><br>

'Arthur, are you su-', the sheriff was cut off from finishing his sentence by the mayor.<br>
'That's a problem dear detective', Vincent began, 'You see mate, an "accidental death" which we both know that you're just protecting the people and is complete crap, won't please the press. See, Arthur, politics isn't what you think it is. The people play no role in this, but, the media, the press, they're the deciding factor.<br><br>

By framing this as a murder, this town could get recognition, in turn, would help us, specially me, get a profit off of them. The press won't dig up this "accidental death"-crap, but instead, if you give them a case like murder, that'll double almost everything, even your fame as a detective'<br><br>       

'I'm not doing it'<br>
'Sorry?', on this response, the mayor was taken aback, for no one had dared to talk to him with the sheer confidence and boldness that Arthur had presented to him with. <br>
'I'm not doing this for the press or for the fame'<br><br>

The instant he said this, Arthur turned and kept his hand on the doorknob to twist and leave the office when the mayor called out to him,<br>
'Alphonse d'Cruz, loan shark, who you own ¬£3,750,<br>
WIlliam Smiths, moneylender, who you own almost ¬£10,000 to, 
Sam Paul, loan shark, who you own ¬£5,500 to.
All that, with interest, is about ¬£45.000. You came to Cloville, not because of luck, did ya? Instead, you "escaped" Brawk to leave behind your previous life and get settled here, am I missing something?'<br>

The answer to the last question was an obvious no, and everyone in the room had figured it out. Arthur's hands, trembling, his heart, pounding with a loud rythmic "bad-um, bad-um" which made Arthur feel it's placed close to his ears. There was now no possible escape from this situation. If Arthur was to still deny the order in the false accusations, his details would be now public, and would make it easy for the loan sharks to find him. <br>

The only answer here was yes.
<hr>
PART III: TO KILL THE WOUNDED MOUSE<br><br>

MR. Garcia was turned over the following week. His son, daughter and wife cried, held the feet of the policemen to have sympathy over them and pleaded with them with all their might, with npo avail. Garcia, now had no power. Although it was widely said he would do no such thing, there was no one who could save him. <br><br>

Without the financial support from the only working man in the family, the family crumbled and drowned in poverty. The only escape from out of this situation was the escape from life itself by the means of death. <br><br>

The gun, stored for emrgencies in the safe of the house seemed the only way to acheive this. There was no hesitation in loading it, and ultimately, pulling the triggering. The three, had commited suicide. <br><br>

The news reached the man in prison half-hour later.<br> <br>

Garcia cried uncontrolably, his legs shook in uncontrolably, his hands trembled in fear, the soles of his feet sweat, his heart thumped like a rock, blood gushed through his veins faster than ever. He was as helpless as a lamb surrounded by hungry tigers, which the tiger in this case was the politics that had trapped him in this position the first place. <br><br>

The mayor's government put out a statement saying that the mayor's case was solved by someone sent from their government, whch ultimately led him to win the elections.<br><br>

The despairity took over Arthur who, similar to the man he put in jail, was feeling helpless. He was neither unable to lay in bed ang get a good six-hour-sleep, nor was he able to sit on his couch without having a restless felling come over him.<br><br>

Things became bad when he refused to even steop onto his apartment simply because every object there shone his reflection and he was unable to stand it. His reflections seemed to shout at him, for the helpless immigrant stuck in jail, for evrything he had done in his past, and for why he's even living.<br><br>

This was it. He just couldn't take it anymore. Seeing the rope in his drawer as he opened it in despairity, his mind picked on the ceiling fan, the only thing making noise other than Arthur's heart, and stitcthed the idea to hang himslef by tying the rope on the fan and strangle himself.<br> <br>

He took a stool, stood on it, and counted to 3. 1.. 2.. and thud.<br><br>

He jumped off the stool, but the fan couldn't handle the force and collapsed- a good thing for any sane person, except Arthur.<br><br>

"This Lawyer Can Take It All. Call 'Paul Law Firm<sup>TM</sup> Today!", he read the AD on the coverpage of the morning page with his tear-filled pair of eyes. This felt like a sign for him. And it was. He knew this was his only real chance.
